## 📚 Documentation

### 1. Bayes

The Bayes folder contains a notebook that demonstrates how to build a Naive Bayes classifier. You'll learn how to preprocess data, fit the model, and make predictions.

### 2. Decision Tree

In the Decision Tree section, you can explore how decision trees work. The notebook guides you through building a decision tree model, visualizing it, and understanding its strengths and weaknesses.

### 3. Linear Regression

This section covers linear regression in depth. You will work through the mathematical foundations and see how to implement a regression model using Python.

### 4. Support Vector Machines

The SVM folder provides insights into support vector machines. You will learn how to use SVM for classification tasks and understand the concept of hyperplanes.

## 🎨 Visualizations

Visualization plays a critical role in machine learning. Each project includes relevant graphs and charts generated using Matplotlib. These visuals help you interpret the model's performance and the underlying data.
